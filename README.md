# Sales-Conversion

Hello Folks,

I am thrilled to share that I have created Dashboard Of "Paid Search Campaign Of US Shopping Mall" which showcases my skills to be considered as an Aspiring Data Analyst ready for challenging roles in the industry.

So, How I Did It:

Data Preparation:

. Power Query Editor: I imported data in Power BI, and used Power Query Editor to remove unnecessary columns and split values for better analysis.

Data Visualization:

Donut Chart: It helped me to find how many device types were used by people to see Advertisement {Mobile 96(50.53%) & Desktop 94(49.47%)}

Bar Charts:

. Avg Of CV (Conversion Rate) By ADS Category: It shows that which ad categories had the highest click rates, although Black Friday is at the top of the list with 0.19 AVG Of CV.

. Avg Of CTR (Click Through Rate) By ADS Category: It helped me to Which ADS category is clicked by no of people, so coupon code is at the top of the list with 0.36 AVG Of CTR.

. Avg Of CPC (Cost Per Click) By ADS Category: It is used for knowing cost of specific ads divided by click, less CPC is far better than more CPC in terms of ROI, offer is at the top of the list with 1.04, but black friday/cyber monday is performing well at a low CPC of 0.16. However, black friday/cyber monday is way better than offer.

Line Chart:

. Total P&L By Month: Tracked monthly P&L trends, highlighting financial performance over time.

Tree Map: Used to filter by month, making it easy to view month-specific ad performance.

Cards: 

. Used for highlighting key metrics such as Total Impressions, Total clicks, Total Conversions, Total Revenue, Total Cost & Total P&L, providing quick insights into overall campaign success.

These Dashboard helps to make data-driven decisions, evaluate ad category performance & identify trends to improve ROI.
